## About
This is where almost all my work on python both in and out of school is stored. Nobody but me works on it unless otherwise decided. This is just for my own education or experience and serves no actual use.

## Info
Each of the files in the projects folder is run from here. The numbers on each file correspond to the number assigned to them in the importing function. To understand more just look at the code. The tester file is for testing and has no use. There is just some random stuff on there I use that probably doesnt work. :)
